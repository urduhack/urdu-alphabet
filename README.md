Complete collection of Urdu language characters.

## About Urdu Language

Urdu is widely known as the national language of Pakistan, but it is also one of Indiaâ€™s 22 official languages. Modern Standard Urdu, once commonly known as a variant of Hindustani, a colloquial language combining the modified Sanskrit words found in Hindi with wordsbrought to India via Persian, Arabic, Portuguese, Turkish and other languages, is a language with one of the most fascinating and complex histories in the world.

The Urdu alphabet is the right-to-left alphabet used for the Urdu language. It is a modification of the Persian alphabet known as Perso-Arabic, which is itself a derivative of the Arabic alphabet. 
The Urdu alphabet has up to 58 letters with 39 basic letters and no distinct letter cases, the Urdu alphabet is typically written in the calligraphic NastaÊ¿lÄ«q script.

## Encoding

Character encoding may be defined as assigning a unique number to each language character to be processed by the computer. Whenever a character is input from keyboard or other input devices, this particular code is generated internally in the computer. Arbitrary encoding may be defined for any application (e.g. 80 for letter â€˜aâ€™, 81 for letter â€˜bâ€™). However, if different vendors are defining arbitrary encodings, their encodings may not agree with one another. 

With the advent of the Internet, it has now become increasingly essential to standardize the encoding scheme because users are accessing data created by a variety of sources through web browsers (a single application). Realizing the significance of standardizing encoding, work was done early for English and American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) was defined in 1968. This standard had 128 slots defined using 7 bits by American National Standards Institute (ANSI).

## What is Unicode?

Initially most documentation was done in a single language, therefore 8-bit single language code pages served the need. However, in 1990s, with increasing needs for multi-lingual documents (where one could require Japanese and Arabic in the same document), it was realized that defining 8-bit code pages were not a scalable solution. Adding code pages for various languages and scripts and using them together in one application created a lot of difficulty and complexity in processing because users had to keep toggling between them.

To address this issue, major vendors got together and created Unicode consortium (www.unicode.org). This consortium started working on developing a singular, unified and universal code chart which would contain all characters of all languages. As 8-bit (256 slots) code pages were insufficient for this requirement, Unicode character encoding standard was developed using 16 bits (65536 slots). This space has been divided to cater to various scripts and thus bypassed the need for toggling for different languages.

## Quick start

`urdu_characters.py` contains complete urdu characters with unicode Range (0600 - 06ff). This file contains three type of characters list. 

- `URDU_DIGITS` set contains 10 URDU DIGITS.
- `URDU_ALPHABET` set contains 44  characters.
- `URDU_PUNCTUATION` set contains 6 PUNCTUATION characters.
- `DIACRITICS` set contains 4 basic characters.

## Python2 vs Python3

Python 2 used the ASCII alphabet, so when you type a string like "Hello, World" it is handled as ACII which is unfortunately limited to several hundred characters and is not very flexible for encoding non-English characters. To use Unicode character encoding, which supports 128,000+ characters across modern and historic languages, youâ€™d have to type u"Hello, World", with the u prefix donating Unicode.

Python 3 on the other hand uses Unicode by default. This allows for far greater language support as well as displaying items like emojis.

## Urdu vs Arabic Characters Challenge

Unicode provides support for Urdu language but there is a problem we have to cater in order to utilise that support. The Urdu is incorporated in Arabic language's block in the Unicode table as Urdu is derived from Arabic script. This makes things a little bit complicated for computer scientists trying to develop applications for Urdu language.

For example consider a word "Ø®Ø§Ù…ÙˆØ´ÛŒ", now if we see the codes at the back-end for this word we can find two different sets of codes form Unicode table.

Set of codes #1

Set of codes #2
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/QiaBoUJ.png">

Now the problem is how do we know on which codes we have to train our model on? If we train our model on a specific range (Urdu 0600-06ff) and our dataset has some words formed using the Arabic set of codes then our application will fail to recognize those words resulting in low accuracy. This redundancy in codes of words hinders us to achieve a high accuracy.

So how do we handle this issue? You can go up and look at the Urdu Unicode Range table. Unicode has standardized this range (0600-06ff) for Urdu only. So all we need to do is to do some data pre-processing before running any alogrithm on data. For each word in data having redundant codes, we can replace that word with the same standardized Urdu word belonging to the range 0600 to 06ff. That's it!
